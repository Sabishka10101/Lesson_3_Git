        <p>
            Located in the heart of the old continent, Germany is compelled of 16 states and is well known for being the largest<br>
            national economy in Europe and one of the biggest in the world. With an interesting and rich history narrated by the<br>
            old-fashion and colorful architecture, castles, palaces, cathedrals and monuments themselves, its landscapes, mountains<br>
            and forests, delicious food and beer, Germany remains one of the top destinations in the world for travelers.<br>
            Usually when one says Germany, among the first things that come to people’s mind is Hitler, the Berlin Wall and beer.<br>
            However, Germany is not all about that. Travelers who have visited the country know that Germany is actually not only an<br>
            economically and politically powerful country, but it also has a rich culture, with a population that has an<br>
            extraordinary respect for tradition, history and humanity.<br>
            In this article, we have listed some of the things that Germany is very well known for, and given some interesting facts<br>
            on how they became so known, and what makes them so interesting.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Beer</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Of course, beer is the first one. Have you ever tried to think about how a German looks, and not seen him holding a huge<br>
            beer mug in his hand?! Germans are the second largest beer consumers in Europe, after the Czech. Only in 2012 alone,<br>
            Germans drank 2.25 gallons of beer, which is actually the lowest level since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1990.<br>
            It is estimated that the average German consumes around 140 liters of beer per year. Germans do not only love to drink<br>
            beer, but they also love to brew it. There are around 1300 German breweries and 5000 brew brands that produce around 115<br>
            hectoliters of beer per year. It is estimated that if you decide to taste every day another different type of beer in<br>
            Germany, you would need 15 years to taste all of them.<br>
            There is also a more than 500-hundred-year old law on beer that is called Reinheitgebot and states that only barley,<br>
            hops and water shall be used in the brewing of beer.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Football</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Germany National Football Team remains one of the strongest football teams, having won a total of four World Cups (1954,<br>
            1974, 1990, 2014) so far. Just like beer, football is a very strong trait with which Germany is identified.<br>
            Some of today’s most well-known football players are from Germany as Miroslav Klose, Toni Kroos, Manuel Neuer, and Mesut<br>
            Özil, who play for teams like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Arsenal.<br>
            Whenever there is a match of the German National Team, or one of the German Football Clubs as Bayern Munchen or Borussia<br>
            Dortmund playing at the UEFA Champions League (and even for the other teams), cafeterias, restaurants, and even the<br>
            municipalities put big screens in order to show the game. A lot of people gather in front of these screens, from<br>
            grandmas to kids and watch the game together while drinking beer and eating the famous German sausages.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Palaces & Castles</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Middle Age castles and palaces built by the European nobility are among the most important buildings in the German<br>
            architectural history. It is estimated that there are around 25 thousand castles throughout the whole country. The<br>
            difference between castles and palaces is that the first were built for defense in a battle while the second were<br>
            designed more as only a residence for the wealthy noblemen of the time.<br>
            If you are in Germany and you fail to see from close at least one castle and one palace then you have lost a lot in<br>
            terms of experience and learning about Germany. Below we have listed few of the most famous palaces and castles of the<br> 
            country.<br>

            world of Harry Potter, is built in the tiny city of Cochem that has around 5,000 citizens. The castle has many towers,<br>
            one of which is called Witches Towers. It is believed that during the 17th century witch-hunt, women suspected of<br>
